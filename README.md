# Linear-Regression-Project
Project Summary. Trip duration is the most fundamental measure in all modes of transportation. Hence, it is crucial to predict the trip-time precisely for the advancement of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) and traveller information systems. In order to predict the trip duration, data mining techniques are employed in this project to predict the trip duration of rental bikes in Seoul Bike sharing system. The prediction is carried out with the combination of Seoul Bike data and weather data.

Tasks :
1. What are the factors that influence the number of bikes rented?
2. Explore the data for outliers and missing values.
3. Plot the correlation between the variables and state your comments
4. Please build a linear regression model to predict rented bike count by choosing appropriate independentvariables.
5. Coment on Model performance by using approapriate diagnostics and measures.
